Feb 6: May want to have the index store hashes with keys based on doc ids and values based on
frequency; have to rewrite create document vectors in query.py;

-count the times in which the tokens appear as substrings as well?

-read queries from xml file with multiple roots; I had to add root tag to make it valid XML...
